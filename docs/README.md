```

## Usage

- [Integrating `box2d-wasm` into your application](00-importing-box2d-wasm.md)
  - Also refer to the [demos](../demo) for examples
- [Make a falling box](01-make-a-falling-box.md)
  - Prints coordinates to the console
- [Draw the falling box](02-draw-the-falling-box.md)

Refer also to [box2d.js](https://github.com/kripken/box2d.js/)'s documentation and demos; the code examples are broadly compatible, because we bind Box2D functionality the same way.

Refer to [Box2D's documentation](https://box2d.org/documentation/) for explanations of concepts.
