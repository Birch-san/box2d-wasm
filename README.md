# box2d-wasm

Box2D compiled to WebAssembly. [Demo](https://birchlabs.co.uk/box2d-wasm/demo/).  
_Demo includes sourcemaps to original C++ source._

There are a few directories in this monorepo:

- [`box2d`](https://github.com/erincatto/box2d)
  - This is a git submodule of the [`box2d`](https://github.com/erincatto/box2d) C++ source code.
- **[`box2d-wasm`](box2d-wasm)**
  - Compiles [`box2d`](https://github.com/erincatto/box2d) to WebAssembly
    - Compiled using [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/index.html) toolchain
  - Creates `.js` bindings to WebAssembly functionality
    - Exported functionality is described as `.idl` WebIDL bindings
    - Bindings emitted via [WebIDL binder](https://emscripten.org/docs/porting/connecting_cpp_and_javascript/WebIDL-Binder.html)
  - Creates `.d.ts` declarations for `.js` bindings
    - Declarations generated by [`webidl-to-ts`](webidl-to-ts)
- [`webidl-to-ts`](webidl-to-ts)
  - Generates TypeScript `.d.ts` declarations from `.idl` [WebIDL bindings](https://emscripten.org/docs/porting/connecting_cpp_and_javascript/WebIDL-Binder.html) files.
    - `.idl` file parsed using W3C's [WebIDL parser](https://github.com/w3c/webidl2.js/)
    - TypeScript declarations created with TypeScript Compiler API
- [`demo`](demo)
  - Svelte application that demonstrates how to consume [`box2d-wasm`](box2d-wasm) via TypeScript

## Project aims

Project aims (compared to existing [`box2d.js`](https://github.com/kripken/box2d.js/)):

- Support Box2D v2.4.0+ and its new cmake build system
- ~~Add source maps back to original C++ source~~
  - This works (you can play around with it in the [demo](https://birchlabs.co.uk/box2d-wasm/demo/))
  - Isn't super helpful
  - Pretty fiddly to deploy
  - Smaller build is preferable (build encounteres errors if both link-time optimizations and source maps are enabled)
- Demo should demonstrate how to consume library via TypeScript
- Strive for nice development experience (try to eliminate steps that involve manual copying of build artifacts)
- Generate TypeScript declarations for WebIDL interface
- Avoid pulling Box2D C++ into repository (prefer git submodule)
- Keep build artifacts out of git (prefer to publish to npm)
- If multiple versions of Box2D are to be maintained, this should be done via branches (and changing the commit of the box2d submodule)
- Documentation not currently planned, but TypeScript declarations and demos would be a start.
- ~~Offload processing to web worker~~
  - This is possible, but the development experience (in rollup at least) is horrid (no debugging, no livereload)
  - Project structure, build system and serving get pretty complicated
  - Proof-of-concept: https://github.com/Birch-san/box2d-wasm/tree/web-workers
    - The only remaining step would be to implement a renderer (make the worker `postMessage()` the world data to the UI thread for rendering)
    - But it could be fiddly to work out "when should I clear the canvas" between draws

## Developing in this monorepo

### Clone repository

Clone this repository using --recursive, to ensure that the [`box2d`](https://github.com/erincatto/box2d) submodule is available.  
_Tutorial: [Using submodules in Git](https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/GitSubmodules/article.html)_

```bash
# start in root of repository
git clone --recursive git@github.com:Birch-san/box2d-wasm.git
cd box2d-wasm
```

#### Instantiate packages

[`pnpm`](https://pnpm.js.org/) is used to manage packages in this monorepo. In particular, it creates a symlink that enables `demo` to consume build artifacts from `box2d-wasm`.

```bash
# from root of repository
npm i -g pnpm
pnpm i
# compile webidl-to-ts from TS to JS, so that box2d-wasm can consume it to generate typings
pnpm build --filter=webidl-to-ts
```

### Compile Box2D to WASM + generate .js and .d.ts bindings

See README of [`box2d-wasm`](box2d-wasm) package.

### Run demo

See README of [`demo`](demo) package.
